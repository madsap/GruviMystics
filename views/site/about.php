                    Meet Ann Roman, Master Psychic, Medium, Intutive Counselor, Healer and founder of Gruvi Mystics.<br/><br/> 
                    Ann Roman, Native to the San Francisco Bay Area, California, has touched the globe with her amazing work!
                    At the young age of 5 she became acutely aware of her gift.. 
                    Her Nana taught her how to read tea leaves when she was a child, something she passed on to her children and grandchildren. 
                    At the age of fifteen, she started having spiritual visits from the other side, 
                    leaving her bewildered with knowledge and information far beyond her years. It was at this time, in the 1970's,
                    Ann started to do reading for for friends and acquaintances.<br/><br/>
                    Other psychics referred to Ann as the The Rock Star of mediums as Ann wows everyone with her spot on accuracy timing and delivery.
                    Helping everyone she encounters with compassion and love while getting to the heart of the matter.
                    Along the way, she has met many other people in her field, who are masters themselves. 
                    Ann felt it was time do something meaningful and collectively bring the spiritualists to the people.
